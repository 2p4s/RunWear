  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect or store any personal data from users. However, the App may utilize your device's GPS location services to retrieve weather information relevant to your current location. This location data is used solely for the purpose of providing weather-related services within the App.</p>

  <h2>Location Data</h2>
  <p>When you use the App, we may collect and process information about your device's GPS location. This location data is used to obtain weather forecasts and perform calculations based on your current location. We do not store or share your precise location data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may utilize third-party services, such as weather data providers, to obtain weather information. These third-party services have their own privacy policies governing the collection and use of data. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services for more information.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove such information from our systems.</p>
